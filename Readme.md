# mon(1)

  Super-simple monitoring program.

  `mon` spawned from the needlessly complex
  frustration that tools like [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/)
  provide, with their awkward DSLs and setup. `mon` is written
  in C, uses less than 400kb of memory, and is incredibly simple
  to set up.

## Installation

```
$ make install
```

 Too lazy to clone?:

```
$ (mkdir /tmp/mon && cd /tmp/mon && curl -L# https://github.com/visionmedia/mon/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1 && make install)
```

## Usage

```

Usage: mon [options] <command>

Options:

  -V, --version                 output program version
  -h, --help                    output help information
  -l, --log <path>              specify logfile [mon.log]
  -s, --sleep <sec>             sleep seconds before re-executing [1]
  -S, --status                  check status of --pidfile
  -p, --pidfile <path>          write pid to <path>
  -m, --mon-pidfile <path>      write mon(1) pid to <path>
  -P, --prefix <str>            add a log prefix
  -d, --daemonize               daemonize the program
  -a, --attempts <n>            retry attempts within 60 seconds [10]
  -R, --on-restart <cmd>        execute <cmd> on restarts
  -E, --on-error <cmd>          execute <cmd> on error

```

## Example

  The most simple use of `mon(1)` is to simply keep a command running:

```js
$ mon ./myprogram
mon : pid 50395
mon : child 50396
mon : sh -c "./example/program.sh"
one
two
three
```

  You may daemonize mon and disassociate from the term with `-d`:

```js
$ mon ./myprogram -d
mon : pid 50413
```

## Failure alerts

 `mon(1)` will continue to attempt restarting your program unless the maximum number
 of `--attempts` has been exceeded within 60 seconds. Each time a restart is performed
 the `--on-restart` command is executed, and when `mon(1)` finally bails the `--on-error`
 command is then executed before mon itself exits and gives up.

  For example the following will echo "hey" three times before mon realizes that
  the program is unstable, since it's exiting immediately, thus finally invoking
  `./email.sh`, or any other script you like.

```js
mon "echo hey" --attempts 3 --on-error ./email.sh
mon : child 48386
mon : sh -c "echo hey"
hey
mon : last restart less than one second ago
mon : 3 attempts remaining
mon : child 48387
mon : sh -c "echo hey"
hey
mon : last restart less than one second ago
mon : 2 attempts remaining
mon : child 48388
mon : sh -c "echo hey"
hey
mon : last restart less than one second ago
mon : 1 attempts remaining
mon : 3 restarts within less than one second, bailing
mon : on error `sh test.sh`
emailed failure notice to tobi@ferret-land.com
mon : bye :)
```

## Managing several mon(1) processes

  `mon(1)` is designed to monitor a single program only, this means a few things,
  firstly that a single `mon(1)` may crash and it will not influence other programs,
  secondly that the "configuration" for `mon(1)` is simply a shell script,
  no need for funky weird inflexible DSLs.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pids="/var/run"
app="/www/example.com"

mon -d redis-server -p $pids/redis.pid
mon -d "node $app/app" -p $pids/app-0.pid
mon -d "node $app/jobs" -p $pids/jobs-0.pid
mon -d "node $app/jobs" -p $pids/jobs-1.pid
mon -d "node $app/jobs" -p $pids/jobs-2.pid
mon -d "node $app/image" -p $pids/image-0.pid
mon -d "node $app/image" -p $pids/image-1.pid
mon -d "node $app/image-broker" -p $pids/image-broker.pid
```

  I highly recommend checking out jgallen23's [mongroup(1)](https://github.com/jgallen23/mongroup),
  which provides a great interface for managing any number of `mon(1)` instances.

## Logs

  By default `mon(1)` logs to stdio, however when daemonized it will default
  to writing a log file named `./mon.log`. If you have several instances you may
  wish to `--prefix` the log lines, or specify separate files.

## Signals

  - __SIGQUIT__ graceful shutdown
  - __SIGTERM__ graceful shutdown
